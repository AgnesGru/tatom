TAToM: Text Analysis with Topic Models for the Humanities and Social Sciences
=============================================================================

*TAToM: Text Analysis with Topic Models for the Humanities and Social Sciences*
consists of a series of tutorials that introduce basic procedures in
quantitative text analysis with a particular focus on the preparation of a text
corpus for analysis and on exploratory analysis using topic models and machine
learning.

These tutorials are addressed to an audience in the humanities and social
sciences.

Building
========

The project relies heavily on the ``ipython`` Sphinx directive, which is
somewhat fragile.

See ``requirements.txt`` for the packages required for building.
