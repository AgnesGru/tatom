TAToM: Text Analysis with Topic Models for the Humanities and Social Sciences
=============================================================================

*TAToM: Text Analysis with Topic Models for the Humanities and Social Sciences*
consists of a series of tutorials that introduce basic procedures in
quantitative text analysis with a particular focus on the preparation of a text
corpus for analysis and on exploratory analysis using topic models and machine
learning.

Building
========

The project relies heavily on the ``ipython`` Sphinx directive, which is
somewhat fragile.

Building the documentation may be accomplished by the following sequence of
commands. Python 3.3 or higher is required.

#. Install required packages:
   
   ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

#. Build the documentation:

   ``make html``
